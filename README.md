# Facial-Parts-Segmentation-with-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on facial parts segmentation using deep learning techniques. We compare three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures — UNet, SegNet, and PSPNet — on the LaPa dataset. The study evaluates the strengths and limitations of each model in terms of segmentation accuracy, computational cost, and contextual understanding, using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient. The project also explores potential improvements including attention mechanisms, data augmentation strategies, and transformer-based models for future work.
